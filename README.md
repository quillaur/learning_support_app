## Purpose
This app is designed to present study supports to students. All study contents are freely available, open source, and based on freely available online resources. 

## Study selection
Studies are organized in categories which are themselves organized by languages.

## Study pages
The content of the pages is taken from the classes directory and loaded with the code present in the control directory.
The layout of the pages is coded in the view directory.

## Questions
As a student goes through the study, questions will be presented to evaluate his or her understanding and attention level. A point is given for each good answer and one is taken away for each bad answer.

## Certification
If the student scores high enough, he or she is rewarded with a downloadable personnal certificate at the end of the study.
