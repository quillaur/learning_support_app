	"Convolution filtering": [
		{
			"text": "In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between the kernel and an image. The convolution filters use local neighbors to compute the weighted average, and each pixel is used multiple times by its neighbors. Whatch carefully the animation to understand what happens to an image uppon running a convolution filter on it."
